Problem Description
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
NOTE:
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= C <= 103
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 103
Input Format
First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.
Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [60, 100, 120]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50
Input 2:
 A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10
Example Output
Output 1:
 220
Output 2:
 0
Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220
Explanation 2:
 Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore answer is 0.
